        <p>Like Minecraft, the world of tech is one big sandbox, and I wanted to get some sand under my nails. I dipped my toes in with low-code Minecraft puzzle maps when I started streaming on Twitch during COVID, became a QA Tester for Lionbridge working with large enterprise companies like Square Enix, and eventually moved to San Francisco in 2021 to dive in headfirst and attend a bootcamp. Since graduating, I've continued to pursue personal projects and the world of game and web development, testing, and user experience.</p>

        <p>Check out a few of my web projects below, or click on the Minecraft blocks to see some of the cool maps and mods I've worked on!
